No data deletion from any repository (database or 3rd party API) without full confirmation from me
No use of fake data. Do not validate components with fake data unless directly requested, to ensure that dependencies are fully considered at development time.
Not git adding or committing. I will do this after verifying changes.
Refactor regularly - bake it into the task plan
