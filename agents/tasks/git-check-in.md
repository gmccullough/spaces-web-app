# Rules
Do research for this.
Do not make any changes to any files.
Don't respond with anything not in this script.
If I answer commit, only add and commit. DO NOT PUSH.

# Evaluate uncommitted changes

Review the current @Branch (Diff with Main Branch) to understand the business and technical logic in the uncommitted changes.

# Refactoring / cleanup review

Then, provide a list of any test or temporary files that should be deleted before we check in. Ignore files that will be ignored by .gitignore rules. If it looks like we refactored code, look for any duplicate left over code in the commit. If there are such issues, propose a solution and ask if I would like you to apply the fixes. If there are no issues, do not mention this cleanup step.

# Commit message generation

Then, respond with a 2-3 sentence commit note that summarizes the work that was done. Ask me if I would like to commit with the suggested note

# Other guidance

Don't respond with anything else.

If I answer commit, only add and commit. DO NOT PUSH.
