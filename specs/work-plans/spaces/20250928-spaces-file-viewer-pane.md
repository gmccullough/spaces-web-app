## Executive Summary & Scope
Completed on 2025-09-28.

All scope items implemented with keyboard navigation and Spaces selection. See prior TODO file for history.

The panel is live above chat, supports Spaces dropdown, lazy-loaded recursive tree with caching, text viewer with truncation and binary notice, bearer-auth to list/read, and error/unauth states.

Refer to `Endpoint Usage` and `Components & Hooks` sections below for details.

### Status
Accepted

### Notes
- Remaining work tracked separately: test coverage (unit/integration) and any future enhancements (resizable split, markdown preview).

## Components & Hooks
- `src/app/components/SpacesFilesPanel.tsx` – container and layout with Spaces dropdown
- `src/app/components/SpacesFileTree.tsx` – recursive tree with keyboard nav (Up/Down/Left/Right, Enter)
- `src/app/components/SpacesFileViewer.tsx` – text viewer with truncation and binary notice
- `src/app/hooks/useSpacesFileTree.ts` – directory listing per dir with caching
- `src/app/hooks/useSpacesFileContent.ts` – read + base64 decode + MIME detection

## Endpoint Usage
1) GET `/api/spaces` → `{ spaces: string[] }`
2) GET `/api/spaces/:name/files?dir=&recursive=false` → `{ files: FileEntry[] }` (files and directories)
3) GET `/api/spaces/:name/files/[...path]` → bytes with `Content-Type`

## Completion Criteria
- Files panel functions without breaking chat
- Text/binary rendering and limits enforced
- Keyboard navigation works for selection and expand/collapse
- Errors and unauthenticated states surfaced
