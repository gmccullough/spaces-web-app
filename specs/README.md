### Specs

Entry points for product specs and work plans.

- **architecture/**
  - Application architecture overview and logical components
- **business/**
  - Business strategy, validation frameworks, and market analysis
- **product/**
  - Durable product specifications by domain (what/why, stable flows and outcomes)
- **work-plans/**
  - Mutable implementation plans by domain (how/when, tasks, rollout)

See also: `architecture/application-components.md` for the current architecture overview.

## Quick Navigation

### For Architecture Context
ðŸ‘‰ **[Application Components](./architecture/application-components.md)** - Current system architecture
ðŸ‘‰ **[Logical Components](./architecture/logical-components.md)** - High-level component design

### For Business Strategy
ðŸ‘‰ **[Business Strategy](./business/README.md)** - Market analysis and validation frameworks

### For Product Specifications
ðŸ‘‰ **[Product Specs](./product/README.md)** - Domain-organized product requirements

### For Implementation Planning
ðŸ‘‰ **[Work Plans](./work-plans/README.md)** - Implementation lifecycle management

## Documentation Principles

### Specs vs Work Plans
- **Specs** (architecture/, business/, product/): Long-lived, stable documentation of what and why
- **Work Plans** (work-plans/): Mutable, time-bound documentation of how and when

### Cross-References
- All documents should link to related specs and work plans
- Work plans reference product specs for context
- Architecture docs inform both business strategy and implementation plans
