# Architecture Documentation

High-level architectural components and system design patterns.

## Core Documents

### [Application Components](./application-components.md)
Current system architecture overview including:
- Technology stack and frameworks
- Database and storage systems
- Third-party service integrations
- Environment configuration
- Deployment architecture

### [Logical Components](./logical-components.md) 
High-level component design including:
- System component breakdown
- Data flow architecture
- Integration patterns
- Component interaction patterns
- Architectural principles

## Architecture Principles

### Technology Agnostic Design
- Focus on logical patterns over specific implementations
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain flexibility for technology evolution

### Integration-First Thinking
- Design for external service integration
- Plan for API evolution and versioning
- Consider failure modes and fallback strategies

### Scalability Considerations
- Document performance requirements and constraints
- Plan for growth in users, data, and complexity
- Consider operational and maintenance requirements
