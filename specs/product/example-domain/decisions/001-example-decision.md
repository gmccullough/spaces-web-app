# ADR-001: Example Architectural Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This is an example Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that demonstrates the format and content for documenting significant architectural decisions within a domain.

**Problem**: We need to choose a data storage approach for the example domain that balances performance, scalability, and development complexity.

**Constraints**:
- Must support complex queries and relationships
- Must scale to handle 10,000+ records initially, with growth to 100,000+
- Development team has strong SQL experience but limited NoSQL experience
- Budget constraints limit infrastructure complexity

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL with JSONB columns** for the example domain data storage.

**Rationale**:
- Provides relational data integrity for core fields
- JSONB columns offer flexibility for metadata and evolving schema
- Team expertise in SQL reduces learning curve and development time
- Built-in indexing support for both relational and JSON data
- Cost-effective scaling options available

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Developer Productivity**: Team can leverage existing SQL expertise
- **Data Integrity**: ACID transactions and foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
- **Query Flexibility**: Can query both structured and semi-structured data efficiently
- **Indexing Performance**: GIN indexes on JSONB provide fast queries on metadata
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single database technology reduces operational complexity
- **Cost Efficiency**: PostgreSQL is open source with predictable scaling costs

### Negative
- **Schema Evolution**: Changes to core schema require migrations
- **JSON Query Complexity**: Complex JSONB queries can be harder to write and optimize
- **Horizontal Scaling**: More complex than NoSQL solutions for horizontal scaling
- **Memory Usage**: JSONB can use more memory than optimized document stores
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn JSONB-specific query patterns

### Neutral
- **Vendor Lock-in**: PostgreSQL is open source, reducing vendor lock-in concerns
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions available
- **Community**: Large community and extensive documentation

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Pure Relational Model (PostgreSQL without JSONB)
- **Pros**: 
  - Maximum data integrity and consistency
  - Optimal query performance for structured data
  - Familiar development patterns
- **Cons**: 
  - Rigid schema makes evolution difficult
  - Complex joins required for metadata queries
  - Over-normalization could impact performance
- **Decision**: Rejected due to inflexibility for evolving metadata requirements

### Alternative 2: Document Database (MongoDB)
- **Pros**: 
  - Excellent flexibility for evolving schema
  - Natural fit for JSON-like data structures
  - Horizontal scaling built-in
- **Cons**: 
  - Team lacks NoSQL experience
  - Additional operational complexity
  - Potential data consistency challenges
  - Additional infrastructure costs
- **Decision**: Rejected due to team expertise and operational complexity

### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- **Pros**: 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching and flexible data
  - Best performance for read-heavy workloads
  - Clear separation of concerns
- **Cons**: 
  - Increased operational complexity
  - Data synchronization challenges
  - Higher infrastructure costs
  - More complex application logic
- **Decision**: Rejected due to operational complexity for initial implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core structured data in traditional columns
CREATE TABLE example_feature_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Flexible metadata in JSONB column
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

-- Indexes for both structured and JSON data
CREATE INDEX idx_example_items_category ON example_feature_items(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_example_items_status ON example_feature_items(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_example_items_metadata ON example_feature_items USING GIN(metadata);
```

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- Query structured data
SELECT * FROM example_feature_items WHERE category = 'category1';

-- Query JSON metadata
SELECT * FROM example_feature_items WHERE metadata->>'priority' = '5';

-- Complex JSON queries
SELECT * FROM example_feature_items 
WHERE metadata @> '{"tags": ["important"]}';
```

### Migration Strategy
- Start with minimal JSONB usage for truly flexible fields
- Migrate frequently-queried JSON fields to structured columns as patterns emerge
- Use database migrations for schema evolution
- Implement application-level validation for JSON structure

## Related Decisions
- [ADR-002: API Design Patterns](./002-api-design-patterns.md) - Influenced by data model choices
- [ADR-003: Caching Strategy](./003-caching-strategy.md) - Depends on database performance characteristics

## Review Timeline
- **Next Review**: 6 months after implementation (July 2025)
- **Trigger Events**: 
  - Performance issues with current approach
  - Significant changes in data volume or query patterns
  - Team expertise changes (NoSQL experience gained)
  - Infrastructure cost concerns

## Success Metrics
- **Query Performance**: 95% of queries complete in < 100ms
- **Development Velocity**: Feature development time not impacted by data layer complexity
- **Data Consistency**: Zero data integrity issues related to storage choice
- **Operational Overhead**: Database maintenance requires < 2 hours per week
