### Product Specs

Long-lived specs organized by domain. Each domain has an `index.md` and detailed docs.

## Domain Organization

Product specifications are organized by functional domain:

- **[Domain Name]/**: [Brief description of domain scope]
  - `index.md` - Domain overview and key concepts
  - `[feature].md` - Detailed feature specifications
  - `decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for policy-level choices
  - `tests.md` - Testing strategy and coverage for the domain

## Guidelines

### Document Purpose
- Keep these documents focused on **product intent, outcomes, and invariants**
- Document **what** we're building and **why**, not **how**
- Link to corresponding work plans for current implementation efforts
- Maintain long-term stability - these docs should change infrequently

### Domain Structure
Each domain should follow this structure:

```
[domain-name]/
├── index.md              # Domain overview and key concepts
├── [feature-1].md        # Detailed feature specification
├── [feature-2].md        # Another feature specification
├── decisions/            # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── 001-[decision].md # ADR for major architectural choice
│   └── 002-[decision].md # Another architectural decision
└── tests.md             # Testing strategy and coverage
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Specs
1. **Start with user value** - Always begin with why this matters to users
2. **Be specific about outcomes** - Define clear success criteria
3. **Document constraints** - Be explicit about limitations and trade-offs
4. **Link to context** - Connect to business strategy and architecture
5. **Keep it current** - Update specs when requirements change

### Managing Spec Evolution
1. **Version control** - Track changes and rationale
2. **Stakeholder review** - Get input from relevant team members
3. **Implementation alignment** - Ensure work plans reflect current specs
4. **Regular review** - Periodically assess if specs still match reality

### Cross-Domain Coordination
1. **Identify dependencies** - Document how domains interact
2. **Coordinate changes** - Ensure changes don't break other domains
3. **Share patterns** - Reuse successful patterns across domains
4. **Maintain consistency** - Keep similar features consistent across domains

*Product specifications should be living documents that evolve with product understanding while maintaining long-term stability.*
